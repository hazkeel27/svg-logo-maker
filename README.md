## Description 📄

I've created a state-of-the-art tool that lets users quickly and easily create eye-catching business logos in SVG. This accomplishment is supported by a solid foundation of contemporary ES6 principles and object-oriented programming (OOP), which guarantees a modular and extensible codebase. The application smoothly integrates creativity with functionality, revolutionizing logo creation in a user-centric way. It does this by leveraging NodeJS and dependencies like inquirer for user input and jest for thorough testing.

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
npm install inquirer@8.2.4
npm install jest@28.1.3 --save-dev
```

## <a name="usage"></a>Usage 📘

- The user must install Visual Studio Code to run the application.
- Then the user must install the NodeJS library.
- Install the inquirer dependency to ask questions in the terminal.
- Developers can install the jest devdependency to test the code.
- Answer questions asked in the terminal to generate a logo.svg file.

Following is the screenshot of the terminal with questions answered by user. 📷

## <a name="contributing"></a>Contribution 🤝

Although the application makes use of modern ES6 ideas and object-oriented programming, its scope is currently constrained. By adding other features, such a wide variety of logos for clients to choose from easily, users can increase the functionality of the program.

## <a name="tests"></a>Tests 🧪

To run tests, run the following command:

```
node index.js
```
